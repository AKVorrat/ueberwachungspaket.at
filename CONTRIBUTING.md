# Contributing to this repository

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Here are some important hints:

* PRs need to be filed against the beta branch.
* Supporters ("Unterst√ºtzer") need to be added in correct alphabetical order (with the exception of the first entry in the list).
* This project uses tabs (ts=4), not spaces.
